# Configuration

`psxdh` is configured through three layers, applied in order:

1. **Built-in defaults** (`config.Default()`).
2. **YAML config file** (`--config path/to/config.yaml`). Fields in the file
   overlay defaults; missing fields keep their default value.
3. **CLI flags** (`--listen`, `--library`, `--log-level`). Applied after the
   YAML file, so flags always win.

This document is the canonical reference. The on-disk schema is YAML and is
mirrored exactly by `internal/config/config.go`.

---

## CLI

The single binary is `psxdh`. Commands shipping in Phase 1:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `psxdh proxy` | Run the HTTP proxy + library watcher until interrupted. |
| `psxdh doctor` | Probe DNS resolvers + PSN CDN reachability. See [network-resilience.md](network-resilience.md#diagnostic-cli). |
| `psxdh probe <url>` | Classify a URL, resolve it, and run a HEAD/GET diagnostic. |
| `psxdh version` | Print the build version. |
| `psxdh --help` | List subcommands. |

### `psxdh proxy` flags

| Flag | Description | Equivalent YAML |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--config` | Path to a YAML config file. When empty, only defaults + flags apply. | n/a |
| `--listen` | Override the proxy listen address (host:port). | `proxy.listen` |
| `--library` | Override the library directory. | `library.dir` |
| `--log-level` | Override the slog level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). | `log.level` |

Examples:

```bash
# Defaults only (proxy on 0.0.0.0:8080, library at ~/Downloads/psxdh).
psxdh proxy

# Custom port and library.
psxdh proxy --listen 0.0.0.0:9000 --library /srv/psxdh/library

# Production config file.
psxdh proxy --config /etc/psxdh/config.yaml

# Config file + per-run override.
psxdh proxy --config config.yaml --log-level debug
```

On start, the proxy prints a banner with every LAN IPv4 address (interface
name in parentheses), the listen address, library root, and rule count. When
the PC has multiple interfaces — common with a PS5 on a direct Ethernet cable
while the PC uses Wi‑Fi — point the console proxy at the IP on the interface
the cable is plugged into. See [README.md](../README.md#ps5-direct-ethernet-cable-to-pc).

```
psxdh v0.1.0
  LAN IPs:
    192.168.2.1    (en8)
    192.168.1.42   (en0)
  proxy listen:  0.0.0.0:8080
  dashboard:     http://192.168.1.42:8081/?token=…
  library dir:   /home/me/Downloads/psxdh
  library layout: basename
  match rules:   8

Point your PS5 proxy at the IP on the interface it is connected to
  (e.g. 192.168.2.1:8080 for a direct cable; 192.168.1.42:8080 on a shared router).

## config.yaml reference

Defaults target **PS5 on Iranian networks**: dashboard on, cluster master with
`master_as_node`, DoH+UDP resolvers with health ranking, forward retry, partial
cache, and integrity verification. Override any field in a local `config.yaml`.

### Field reference

#### `proxy`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `proxy.listen` | yes | `host:port` for the proxy server. Bind to `0.0.0.0` so the console can reach you over LAN. |

#### `admin`

The embedded web dashboard (the GUI): live capture log, per-title session
progress, library state, and a connectivity panel (DNS resolver health + CDN
reachability). Opt-in. Because it is meant to be opened from a phone on the LAN,
it binds beyond loopback by default and requires a token for any non-loopback
bind.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin.enabled` | no | Start the dashboard. Default true; set false for headless. |
| `admin.listen` | yes (when enabled) | `host:port` for the dashboard. Default `0.0.0.0:8081` so the LAN can reach it. |
| `admin.token` | no | Shared token required for non-loopback binds. Sent via the `X-Psxdh-Token` header or a `?token=` query parameter. Left empty, a token is auto-generated at startup and printed in the banner (with a ready-to-open URL). |
| `admin.auto_open` | no | If true, open the dashboard URL in the default browser on startup. |

#### `library`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `library.dir` | yes | Directory `psxdh` watches and serves files from. `~` is expanded. The directory is created if it does not exist. |
| `library.layout` | yes | `basename` (default) or `per-title`. See [library layouts](#library-layouts) below. |
| `library.watch` | no | When false, the watcher is disabled and the index is populated only by the initial walk. |
| `library.stable_settle_ms` | no | Milliseconds of unchanged size before a file is considered stable and added to the index. Default 2000. |
| `library.ignore_suffixes` | no | Filename suffixes that mark in-progress downloads. Files with these suffixes are skipped by the watcher; the final rename triggers a fresh `KindCreated`. |

#### `match`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `match.ps4` | no | Load the embedded PS4 rule pack. Ignored when `match.rules_dir` is set. |
| `match.ps5` | no | Load the embedded PS5 rule pack. Ignored when `match.rules_dir` is set. |
| `match.rules_dir` | no | Replace embedded defaults with `*.yaml` files from this directory. Files are loaded in lexical order — name files `00-…`, `10-…` to control priority. See [cdn-patterns.md](cdn-patterns.md#overriding-the-default-rules). |

#### `capture`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capture.log_ignored` | no | Publish capture events even for `KindUnknown` URLs. Default false to keep the dashboard signal-to-noise high. |
| `capture.export_formats` | no | Formats the `export` package emits. `txt` (one URL per line) and `aria2` (input-file format with `out=`/`dir=`) are implemented; `fdm` is reserved. |
| `capture.prefetch_sc_metadata` | no | Phase 2: when true, background-fetch the first 64 KB of every captured `_sc.pkg` to parse `param.json` for display metadata. |

#### `handoff`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `handoff.fdm.enabled` | no | Try the OS-specific "Send to FDM" action on per-URL clicks. |
| `handoff.fdm.fdm_binary` | no | Override the FDM binary path. Empty = auto-detect on `PATH` or the default install location. |
| `handoff.fdm.fallback_to_clipboard` | no | If the deep-link / binary handoff fails, copy the URL to the clipboard instead. |
| `handoff.aria2.enabled` | no | Enable the aria2 JSON-RPC client (the dashboard's "→ aria2" action, and `auto_push`). |
| `handoff.aria2.rpc_url` | when enabled | aria2 RPC endpoint, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:6800/jsonrpc` (start aria2c with `--enable-rpc`). |
| `handoff.aria2.rpc_secret` | no | Token matching aria2c's `--rpc-secret`. |
| `handoff.aria2.auto_push` | no | Push every captured PKG URL into aria2 automatically (no copy-paste). Files land in `library.dir` with their original basename. |

#### `forward`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forward.mode` | yes | `auto`: forward everything not in the library. `cache`: forward only classified URLs (block `unknown`). `strict`: never forward — return 502 when no local file exists. See [architecture.md](architecture.md#forward-modes). |
| `forward.passthrough_https` | yes | Always true in v1. `CONNECT` is tunnelled as raw TCP; we never MITM HTTPS. Setting this to false would break PSN login and is rejected by the validator in spirit (kept as a config knob for transparency). |
| `forward.retry.max_attempts` | no | Total attempts (initial + retries). Default `4`; `1` disables retry. |
| `forward.retry.initial_backoff_ms` | no | Wait before the second attempt. |
| `forward.retry.max_backoff_ms` | no | Cap on any single sleep. Must be ≥ `initial_backoff_ms`. |
| `forward.retry.multiplier` | no | Backoff growth factor (default 2.0). |
| `forward.retry.jitter` | no | Fraction in `[0,1]` to randomise each sleep (default 0.2). |
| `forward.partial_cache.enabled` | no | When true, successful non-Range GETs are tee'd to disk and atomically promoted into the library. |
| `forward.partial_cache.min_size_bytes` | no | Minimum response size to cache; default 1 MiB. Below this we skip caching so we don't fill the library with tiny manifests. |
| `forward.partial_cache.resume` | no | Continue a `.partial` left behind by a dropped forward (default true). The remainder is fetched with a Range/If-Range request, gated on the upstream validators still matching; any mismatch falls back to a fresh download. See [docs/network-resilience.md](network-resilience.md#cross-run-resumable-downloads). |

See [docs/network-resilience.md](network-resilience.md) for the
behaviour and the pre-write retry invariant.

#### `network`

All `network.*` fields are documented in detail in
[docs/network-resilience.md](network-resilience.md). Highlights:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `network.dns.mode` | no | `doh+udp` (default) \| `system` \| `udp` \| `doh`. |
| `network.dns.resolvers` | no | Resolver list. `udp` accepts `host[:port]`; `doh` requires `https://…/dns-query`; `doh+udp` accepts both. |
| `network.dns.timeout_ms` | no | Per-resolver budget (default 1500). |
| `network.dns.cache_ttl_s` | no | Fallback TTL when the upstream returns 0 (default 300). |
| `network.dns.cache_max_entries` | no | LRU cap on the in-memory resolver cache (default 4096). |
| `network.dns.health.enabled` | no | Rank the configured resolvers by observed latency/success so a flapping endpoint stops taxing every lookup. The system resolver stays a fixed last-resort tail. See [docs/network-resilience.md](network-resilience.md#dns-resolver-health-ranking). |
| `network.dns.health.reprobe_interval_ms` | no | Background re-probe cadence to keep ranking fresh on an idle link (default 60000). `0` disables the background probe; live traffic still updates the ranking. |
| `network.prefer_ipv4` | no | Try IPv4 addresses before IPv6. |
| `network.dial_timeout_ms` | no | Single-dial timeout (default 10000). |
| `network.upstream_proxy.enabled` | no | Route forward traffic through an HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy. |
| `network.upstream_proxy.url` | when enabled | `http://`, `https://`, `socks5://`, or `socks5h://`. |
| `network.upstream_proxy.only_for_hosts` | no | When set, dial these hosts (and subdomains) through the proxy; others go direct. |
| `network.circuit.enabled` | no | Per-host failure breaker. |
| `network.circuit.failure_threshold` | no | Consecutive failures that open the breaker (default 5). |
| `network.circuit.cooldown_ms` | no | Wait before half-opening (default 30000). |
| `network.bandwidth.forward_bps` | no | Throughput cap on the forward path in bytes/sec (`0` = unlimited). |
| `network.bandwidth.burst_bytes` | no | Token-bucket burst size; `0` defaults to `forward_bps`. |

#### `verify`

Integrity verification so a corrupt download (common on a bad link) is never
served — a failed install after hours is the worst outcome. A library file that
fails verification is treated as "not local": the proxy forwards upstream so the
console re-fetches correct bytes.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verify.crc` | no | Reserved flag for the `.crc` sidecar format. The CRC32/SHA-256 verifier is implemented; the exact PS5 `.crc` byte format is locked in Phase 0. |
| `verify.on_stable` | no | Run `.crc` verification when the watcher promotes a file. If a `<pkg>.crc` sidecar is present and the digest mismatches, the PKG is marked corrupt and not served. |
| `verify.require_size_match` | no | Refuse to serve a local file whose on-disk size differs from the upstream `Content-Length` observed for the same basename. The cheap guarantee that holds even without a `.crc`. |

#### `mdns`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mdns.enabled` | no | Advertise psxdh on the LAN via mDNS/DNS-SD (`_http._tcp`) so the console-setup step doesn't require hunting for the PC's IP. See [ADR 0004](decisions/0004-mdns.md). |
| `mdns.instance_name` | no | Service instance name (default `psxdh`). |

#### `downloader`

The embedded download engine (ADR 0005). A managed aria2c subprocess; required for
`psxdh node` and for the master when `cluster.master_as_node` is true.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `downloader.engine` | no | `aria2` (only engine). |
| `downloader.aria2_binary` | no | Path to `aria2c`; auto-detected on `PATH` when empty. |
| `downloader.allow_http_fallback` | no | When `true`, use the built-in HTTP engine if aria2c is missing (dev/CI only; default `false`). |
| `downloader.rpc_port` | no | aria2 RPC listen port (default 6800). |
| `downloader.rpc_secret` | no | aria2 RPC secret; auto-generated when empty. |
| `downloader.connections_per_server` | no | aria2 `-x` (default 8). |
| `downloader.split` | no | aria2 `-s` (default 8). |
| `downloader.max_concurrent` | no | aria2 `-j` (default 4). |

#### `cluster`

Master/slave distributed download (ADR 0005). The **master** is the node the PS5
proxies through; **slaves** (`psxdh node`) download assigned parts and hand them
back. See the cluster quick-start in [README.md](../README.md).

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cluster.enabled` | no | Turn on cluster behaviour. Default true. |
| `cluster.role` | when enabled | `master` or `slave`. |
| `cluster.node_name` | no | Node label in the dashboard; defaults to the hostname. |
| `cluster.master_as_node` | master | When true, the master also runs the embedded downloader and participates as a download worker, writing parts directly into `library.dir`. |
| `cluster.bind` | when enabled | `host:port` for the cluster/agent API. |
| `cluster.master_url` | slave | Base URL of the master (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8082`). |
| `cluster.token` | no | Shared cluster auth; generated on the master when empty (printed in the banner). Slaves must use the same value. |

#### `jobs`

Portable capture workflow: import a home `capture.jsonl`, optionally enumerate
the full PKG part series from the CDN, and persist resumable job state. See
README "Capture at home, download at work" and
[docs/examples/config.home.yaml](examples/config.home.yaml) /
[docs/examples/config.work.yaml](examples/config.work.yaml).

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jobs.import_on_start` | no | JSONL path imported when the master starts. Empty disables. |
| `jobs.import_enumerate` | no | Probe the CDN for the full `_0.._N` series on import. Default true. |
| `jobs.state_path` | no | JSON snapshot of job progress. Empty disables persistence. |

#### `capture.persist`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capture.persist.enabled` | no | Append every capture event as one JSON object per line to `path`. |
| `capture.persist.path` | when enabled | Destination file; `~` is expanded; parent directories are created. |
| `capture.persist.fsync` | no | `fsync()` after every write. Slow but durable across power loss. |

#### `log`

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `log.level` | yes | One of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. |
| `log.json` | no | When true, emit slog records as JSON to stderr. Useful for shipping logs to a structured log aggregator. |

---

## Library layouts

The library resolver maps a captured URL to a local file via the basename.
Two layouts are supported:

### `basename` (default)

```
library/
├── PPSA01234_00-FAKEPKG_0.pkg
├── PPSA01234_00-FAKEPKG_1.pkg
└── UP1234-CUSA12345_00-OTHERPKG_0.pkg
```

Every file in the tree (recursive walk) is keyed by its basename. This
matches how FDM, aria2, curl, and most browsers save by default. Subfolders
are allowed — they just don't change the lookup.

Limitation: when two titles share a basename (rare in practice, since Sony's
PKG names include the title id), the resolver returns "miss" rather than
auto-picking. Use `per-title` if you hit this.

### `per-title`

```

Same recursive walk, but `Resolve` additionally requires that the URL's
title-id (`PPSA…`, `CUSA…`, or `UP1234-CUSA…`) appears somewhere in the
local path. Use this when you're managing multiple titles in parallel and
want to be defensive about collisions.

## Hot reload

Configuration hot reload is **not** implemented in Phase 1. Restart `psxdh`
to pick up changes. The validation layer will reject malformed config at
startup, so an invalid YAML file fails the start rather than silently
ignoring a typo.

---

## Local overrides

A `config.local.yaml` at the repo root is git-ignored by default
(see `.gitignore`). Useful for keeping a developer-specific library path or
log level out of version control.

```bash
psxdh proxy --config config.local.yaml
```
